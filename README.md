# Hi! I'm Javier Solis 👋🏼
I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Austin ☀️.

I am passionate about coding, learning, and healthcare. I hold a degree in biomedical engineering and a love for biotechnology. 

My focus is in coding lies in the use of React, Vue, and Laravel PHP. However my passion lies in understanding the growing technologies such as serverless infrastructure techniques and machine learning. I currently hold an AWS certification for a Solution Architect Assoc but continue to want to learn more on how to build a variety of applications.
